## <b> Triplea-Games Rules and Guidelines </b>

# <b> Introduction </b>

Hello, member of the triplea-games repository. These are the unofficial guidelines to how act properly on the repository.
As many of you know, it's vital to maintain a proper behaviour when participating in a large-scale repository. Outlined in here are the set of rules expected to be upheld.
If there are any other problems, you can ask any of the moderators present or <a href="https://forums.triplea-game.org/">on the forums.</a>

# <b> Rules </b>

As aforementioned there are certain rules that are required for the well-being of others. Here are the rules:

- Before adding projects, you must undergo verification processes.
- Flaming and profanity of any kind will not be tolerated.
- Do not post any content in the repository that may be degrading or derogatory.
- Do not spam. It is highly discouraged.
- Do not beg to add files to the project. It most likely won't achieve the results expected.
- Do not change ANYTHING in the files unless permission was granted.

All members are to keep these in mind. Although these rules may not be what you want it to be, this is made for the sole purpose to keep the repository safe.
If you have any questions, you can ask me, @JAGDF, or any of the moderators, who may have approved this.
